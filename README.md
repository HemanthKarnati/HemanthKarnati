## ABOUT ME ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Hemanth Karnati, and I am a Computer Engineering major at San Jose State University (SJSU). I am interested in embedded hardware and software. 

My favorite programming languages are C, C++, and Python. I also enjoy hardware programming and hardware development via PCB design, using software such as Verilog and Altium.

## PROJECTS DEVELOPED ðŸ’»

Some of the projects that I have done are: 

1. SJSU FSAE
   - I developed the Tractive System Active Light PCB
   - I assisted in the development of the Power Distribution Unit
   - I am currently the lead hardware developer for the Telemetry Control System (TCS)
   - I am currently assisting firmware development for TCS
   - Skills used: Altium PCB design software, ESP-idf, FreeRTOS, Serial Communication Protocols (UART, I2C, SPI), Lab equipment
     
2. HYDROLINK systems
   - I assisted in the development of the power management software, as I wrote code to change the power mode of the processor based on GPIO inputs
   - I led the development of the custom PCB hardware for this IoT device
   - Skills used: KiCAD PCB design software, ESP-idf, FreeRTOS
     
3. MSP432 TI Launchpad 
   - Programmed various aspects such as memory, RTOS, and low level drivers
   - Skills used: C programming, RTOS, CRC, DMA, Flash & SRAM memory, ISRs

4. RISC-V Microprocessor
   - Developed a program to replicate a RISC-based Microprocessor
   - Used a 5 stage execution pipeline with register sheets and load/store functionality
   - Skills used: Verilog programming, C programming
  
5. Tiny-C Compiler
   - Developed a mock C interpreter
   - This interpreter has the functionality to break certain C programming to intermediate code
   - Skills used: Python programming, C programming, Compilers & Interpreters

6. Robot Design Lab
   - Developed autonomous software using C++ that allowed a robot to perform specific actions based on sensor input using libraries, allowing for optimization and clean code
   - Developed and tested electrical components using LTSpice to wire sensors to Arduino microprocessor
   - Skills used: C++ programming, LTspice, soldering, lab equipment
